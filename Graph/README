DataStructures
===============

#### Project Overview

Author  - John Allard
License - None, but feel free to use, distribute, modify, or make fun-of the code as you see fit.

The purpose of this project is to implement a general graph data structure in C++, which I will then add to my collection of homemade data-structures.
The plan is to implement a grpah as both an adj. matrix and adj. list, with both of these classes deriving from the same interface.
