*	@Purpose  - This is the definition of the Edge (Directed Edge) class, which will be used by the different Graph classes in this directory. 
*				wEdge is a simple data structure that contains references to it's two endpoints, "from" and "to", and a weight. This weight will have a default
*				value of 1, so if the user wishes to implement an unweighted graph they can still use this class.
