*   @Purpose  - This is my implementation of the uGraph (undirected Graph) class defined in uGraph.h. This class represents a templated, undirected graph,
*				upon which a user can perform operation like searches, path finding, and other things. This class was implemented as part of my C++ 
*				Data Structures personal project. All code is open license and free to use.
