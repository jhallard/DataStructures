<h4 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h4>
<p><strong>DataStructures</strong> is a collection of data structures implemented using the C++ programming language and some C++11 features.
The structures created in this project are all fully templated and made to be as general, efficient, and reliable as possible. This is a personal project developed to improve my understanding of the fundamental data structures, but if you are interested in contributing to this project please email me (john@jhallard.com) and we can work something out. All code in this project is currently unlicensed, but feel free to use, distribute, or poke fun at anything you wish.</p>
<h5 id="build">Build</h5>
<p><strong>Note</strong> - <em>The project is not currently build ready, and can&#39;t be used as a library for your use. Certain self-containted parts, like the graphs, are working and tested, those could be manually included into a project.</em></p>

<p>Graphs are one of the most powerful and all-encompasing data structures known to man, and they are the source for some of the most interesting problems in computer science. This project contains a few different graph implementations, all of which come with their own implementation of BFS, DFS, min-cut, dijkstra&#39;s, and other popular graph algorithms. Below is a listing of the various flavors of graphs that are implemented.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>GraphInterface - <code>/Graphs/GraphInterface/</code> : The interface class from which all of graph implementations in this project derive. </li>
<li>uGraph - <code>/Graphs/GraphAdjList/UndirectedGraph/</code> : An implementation of a undirected graph that uses a series of adjacency lists to internally represent the graph structure. Almost fully implemented an tested, needs some more work.</li>
<li>dGraph - <code>/Graphs/GraphAdjList/DirectedGraph/</code> :  An implementation of a undirected graph that uses a series of adjacency lists to internally represent the graph structure. Currently about 75% implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h4>
<ul class="list">
<li>HashDictionary - <code>Dictionaries/HashDictionary/</code> : This data structure represents a dictionary that uses hashing to insert and locate items. To resolve collisions, we use chaining with linked lists. I first implemented this for a data structures class around the spring of 2014, but I have recently begun to add changes and make improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="directory-structure-">Directory Structure :</h4>
<ul class="list">
<li><code>/Graphs/</code> <ul class="list">
<li><code>GraphAdjList/</code><ul class="list">
<li><code>UndirectedGraph/</code> - A templated, undirected graph that uses a vector of adjacency lists to represent the graph internally.</li>
<li><code>DirectedGraph/</code> - A templated, directed graph that also uses adjacency lists to represent the graph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>GraphAdjMat/</code><ul class="list">
<li>(Currently Unimplemented) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>/Dictionaries/</code><ul class="list">
<li><code>HashDictonary</code> - A templated dictionary that uses chaining to resolve collisions. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>BUGS</code> -  Contains a list of bugs and possible enhancements for each project.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s next?</h4>
<p>In the future I plan to implement at least the following data structures :</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><code>PriorityQueue</code> - I will most likely try to implement a priority queue in a few different ways, including binary and fibonacci heaps.</li>
<li><code>Tree</code> - I would like to implement a few different tree flavors, included binary, AVL, Red/Black, n-ary, and possibly others. The current implementation of BinaryTree is only partially mine, the code was supplied by a textbook but was incomplete (would not compile), I completed it and added more features, but I would like to start my own from scratch.</li>
<li><code>Deque</code> - A deque can be used as a stack, a queue, or a deque, so implementing this one data structure would be quite useful. The priority queue can possibly derive from this class and just override the insetion and deletion functions.</li>
</ul>
